	<p>A short childrens story</p>

	<h2>The story</h2>
	<ul>
		<li style="background-color:SlateBlue;">After flying a long distance, a thirsty crow was wandering the forest in search of water.</li>
		<li style="background-color:SlateBlue;">Finally, he saw a pot half-filled with water.</li>
		<li style="background-color:SlateBlue;">He tried to drink from it but his beak wasn’t long enough to reach the water inside.</li>
            <li style="background-color:SlateBlue;">He then saw pebbles on the ground and one by one.</li>
		<li style="background-color:SlateBlue;">He put them in the pot until the water rose to the brim.</li>
            <li style="background-color:SlateBlue;">The crow then hastily drank from it and quenched his thirst.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 style="border:2px solid Violet;">Moral of the story:</h2>
	  
      <p style="border:2px solid Violet;">If there’s a will, there’s a way. Every problem has a solution if we just look hard enough and don’t give up.</p>
